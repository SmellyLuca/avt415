      Ramsey is a social media influencer, and posts photos of his outfits
      daily. He's starting to run out of outfits and doesn't want to repeat the
      same outfit, so he looks online for some new footwear that'll have his
      followers engaging with his posts more. He finds Monte Bronco, and browses
      around the site and social media to see how they style their prodcuts. He
      finds a few he likes, and places an order online.
