    <h1>10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design</h1>
    <h3>
      <span style="color: rgb(101, 101, 252)">Summary:</span
      ><span class="summary_text">
        Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design. They are
        called "heuristics" because they are broad rules of thumb and not
        specific usability guidelines.</span
      >
    </h3>
    <h4>By <span style="font-weight: 700;"">Jakob Nielsen</span> on Apr. 24, 1994; Updated Nov. 15, 2020</h4>

    <h2>#1: Visibility of system status</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="bold"
        >The design should always keep users informed about what is going on,
        through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.</span
      ><br />
      When users know the current system status, they learn the outcome of their
      prior interactions and determine next steps. Predictable interactions
      create trust in the product as well as the brand.
    </p>

    <h2>#2: Match between system and the real world</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="bold"
        >The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and
        concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon. Follow
        real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and
        logical order.</span
      ><br />
      The way you should design depends very much on your specific users. Terms,
      concepts, icons, and images that seem perfectly clear to you and your
      colleagues may be unfamiliar or confusing to your users. When a design’s
      controls follow real-world conventions and correspond to desired outcomes
      (called natural mapping), it’s easier for users to learn and remember how
      the interface works. This helps to build an experience that feels
      intuitive.
    </p>

    <h2>#3: User control and freedom</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="bold"
        >Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked
        "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action without having to go
        through an extended process.</span
      ><br />
      When it's easy for people to back out of a process or undo an action, it
      fosters a sense of freedom and confidence. Exits allow users to remain in
      control of the system and avoid getting stuck and feeling frustrated.
    </p>

    <h2>#4: Consistency and standards</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="bold"
        >Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or
        actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry
        conventions.</span
      ><br />
      Jakob's Law states that people spend most of their time using digital
      products other than yours. Users’ experiences with those other products
      set their expectations. Failing to maintain consistency may increase the
      users' cognitive load by forcing them to learn something new.
    </p>

    <h2>#5: Error prevention</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="bold"
        >Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully
        prevent problems from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate
        error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a
        confirmation option before they commit to the action.</span
      ><br />
      There are two types of errors: slips and mistakes. Slips are unconscious
      errors caused by inattention. Mistakes are conscious errors based on a
      mismatch between the user’s mental model and the design.
    </p>

    <h2>#6: Recognition rather than recall</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="bold"
        >Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and
        options visible. The user should not have to remember information from
        one part of the interface to another. Information required to use the
        design (e.g. field labels or menu items) should be visible or easily
        retrievable when needed.</span
      ><br />
      Humans have limited short-term memories. Interfaces that promote
      recognition reduce the amount of cognitive effort required from users.
    </p>

    <h2>#7: Flexibility and efficiency of use</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="bold"
        >Shortcuts — hidden from novice users — may speed up the interaction for
        the expert user so that the design can cater to both inexperienced and
        experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.</span
      ><br />
      Flexible processes can be carried out in different ways, so that people
      can pick whichever method works for them.
    </p>

    <h2>#8: Aesthetic and minimalist design</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="bold"
        >Interfaces should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely
        needed. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with
        the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative
        visibility.</span
      ><br />
      This heuristic doesn't mean you have to use a flat design — it's about
      making sure you're keeping the content and visual design focused on the
      essentials. Ensure that the visual elements of the interface support the
      user's primary goals.
    </p>

    <h2>#9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="bold"
        >Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes),
        precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a
        solution.</span
      ><br />
      These error messages should also be presented with visual treatments that
      will help users notice and recognize them.
    </p>

    <h2>#10: Help and documentation</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="bold"
        >It’s best if the system doesn’t need any additional explanation.
        However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users
        understand how to complete their tasks.</span
      ><br />
      Help and documentation content should be easy to search and focused on the
      user's task. Keep it concise, and list concrete steps that need to be
      carried out.
    </p>

    <h2>Note from Jakob</h2>
    <p>
      I originally developed the heuristics for heuristic evaluation in
      collaboration with Rolf Molich in 1990 [Molich and Nielsen 1990; Nielsen
      and Molich 1990]. Four years later, I refined the heuristics based on a
      factor analysis of 249 usability problems [Nielsen 1994a] to derive a set
      of heuristics with maximum explanatory power, resulting in this revised
      set of heuristics [Nielsen 1994b].<br /><br />
      In 2020, we updated this article, adding more explanation, examples, and
      related links. While we slightly refined the language of the definitions,
      the 10 heuristics themselves have remained relevant and unchanged since
      1994. When something has remained true for 26 years, it will likely apply
      to future generations of user interfaces as well.
